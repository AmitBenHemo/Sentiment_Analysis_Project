## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sentiments of tweets about airlines and classify them into positive or negative categories. The project involves preprocessing text data, building a neural network model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Airline Tweets Sentiment Dataset**, which contains tweets labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). For this project, we exclude the neutral sentiments to focus only on positive and negative sentiments.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tensorflow (with Keras)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Download the dataset:**

    Place the `Tweets.csv` file in the project directory.

3. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Sequential model with the following layers:

- **Embedding layer:** Converts input words to dense vectors of fixed size.
- **SpatialDropout1D layer:** Applies dropout to the input to prevent overfitting.
- **LSTM layer:** Processes the input sequences and captures temporal dependencies.
- **Dropout layer:** Regularizes the network to prevent overfitting.
- **Dense layer:** Outputs the final classification with a sigmoid activation function.

## Training

The model is trained using the following configurations:

- **Loss function:** Binary cross-entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Metrics:** Accuracy
- **Validation split:** 20%
- **Epochs:** 3
- **Batch size:** 32

## Evaluation

The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs. The plots are saved as `Accuracy plot.jpg` and `Loss plot.jpg`.

## Predicting Sentiment

A function `predict_sentiment` is provided to predict the sentiment of new tweet texts. Example usage:

```python
test_sentence1 = "I enjoyed my journey on this flight."
predict_sentiment(test_sentence1)

test_sentence2 = "This is the worst flight experience of my life!"
predict_sentiment(test_sentence2)
```

## Results

The model achieves satisfactory accuracy in classifying tweets as positive or negative. The training and validation accuracy and loss plots provide insights into the model's performance.
